Building a modern data warehousing with SQL Server, Including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics.
# SQL Data Warehousing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a data warehouse using SQL. It integrates data from multiple sources, enables efficient querying, and supports analytical reporting to derive actionable insights.

## Features
- Data modeling and schema design (e.g., star schema, snowflake schema).
- ETL processes for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Aggregated and partitioned datasets for efficient querying.
- SQL scripts for complex queries and data analysis.
- Visualization support using third-party tools (optional).

## Technologies
- SQL (structured query language)
- Database Management System (DBMS): [e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MS SQL Server]
- ETL Tool: [e.g., Talend, Informatica, or Python-based custom scripts]
- Visualization: [e.g., Tableau, Power BI] (optional)
